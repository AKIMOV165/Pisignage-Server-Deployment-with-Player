* PiSignage players can be managed centrally using managed services at pisignage.com or using a separate server using open sourced server software or independently using player webUI (http://player-ip:8000).
*  Download image and Prepare the SD card (minimum 16GB, class 10 or above) and follow the steps below:
{
1. Download the complete player iso image
For all Raspberry Pi models except Pi Zero (including 0W, 02W),Pi 1,Pi 2
Version 5.3.2 (based on 64bit Raspberry OS released on Nov 2024)

For Raspberry Pi Zero (including 0W, 02W),1,2
Version 5.3.2 (based on 32bit Raspberry OS released on Nov 2024 with armv6-nodejs)

Other images based on older Raspberry OS versions
recommended version for Raspberry Pi 3 & Pi 4 1GB model even today!, uses propreitory omxplayer to display video
3.2.9 based on Raspberry Buster OS or 3.2.9
Version 5.1.0_legacy(also called 4.9.0 earlier) Based on 32bit Raspberry Legacy OS(X) released on Dec 2023 and uses X windows as display manager.
2.9.7-armv6 image for Pi 0/0W/1/2
4.9.0 image for Radxa Rock 4C+ ONLY
2. Program the downloaded image to a SD card (Simple copy-paste of the file into the SD card will not work!)
Use application such as:

Raspberry Pi Imager, use custom option for OS and do not use additional customizations like ssh, Wi-Fi, autologin etc., it will be configured by piSignage
or balena Etcher
3. Insert the programmed SD card into the Raspberry Pi and power ON.
4. Register your player with player id at pisignage.com to manage from the cloud or over LAN.
}
Done.
